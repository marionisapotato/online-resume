            <li><h2>Summary</h2></li><br>
            Creative who has been working in the fashion luxury industry over 10 years. <br>I have been fortunate enough to work in a diverse range of roles, including press office assistant to being a private client stylist.<br>
             Some of the achievements I've secured across my career to date include styling actors and directors for red carpets, but also working with private clients on their personal and professional events.<br>  
I am passionate, entirely involved when I work on a project, well organised and a problem solver. Curious and quick learner, I always look to improve myself. I am hard-worker, adaptable, and an incredible team worker.
